The project is a part of GVC Lab (during third semester). It presents the user with a scenario where the user 
owns a castle in hte middle of ocean where several pirate ships are sailing. The aim of the game is to destroy
as many pirate ships as possible by typing the word hovering above the pirate ship. 

The game is built using C++ and OpenGL. You should follow the instructions in library/ to install OpenGL libraries
on your system. You can then play the game through "executable/Fall of the caribbean.exe"

Its been a long time since we wrote the code and it is therefore in a very ugly state. 
I will clean up the code as soon as possible.
